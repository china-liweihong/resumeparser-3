		Objective
Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2015.
		
		Experience
Summer Intern at NASA Ames Research Center	July-Aug 2013
Worked on EGraClus: Evolutionary Graph Clustering Algorithm. Used linear algebra and graph algorithm techniques to provide enhancements to the clustering algorithm. Utilized the Twitter API to develop dynamic social networking graphs in order to provide test cases for the algorithm, using Python and MATLAB. I also developed pixel data analysis tools used for terrain analysis.
Winter Intern at NASA Ames Research Center	January 2014
I worked on software for evaluating airline fuel consumption in MATLAB. I added to and modified the code to ensure functionality and efficient runtime, as well as adjusting portions to run distributedly.
